**Summary**
This Application was meant to be a crowd sourced photo anlysis tool.

**Install**
This Repo is more or less straight forward. You will need to create your database tables in your environment
I have ommited seed data so you will need to create your own. If you would like to use the facebook login functionality 
you will need to create your own keys. 

**Notes**
Their are a couple of items that are currently setup in the code but not in use.

- paperclip gem 
- kickchart gem

This code is there as preparation to complete some of the backlog. * In addition you 
will find that oauth is only partially implemented.

**Backlog**
- Full Facebook integration
- Ability to include photos from facebook
- Ability to upload (via paperclip)
- Cool javascript animations
- Strong parameter for vote model
- Kick charts rather than number display for votes
